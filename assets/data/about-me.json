  "about": [
    "I’m a game developer focused on building tight gameplay, clean tools, and performant systems. I enjoy the intersection of design and engineering—turning rough ideas into shippable, polished experiences.",
    "My recent work ranges from prototyping gameplay loops and building in-editor tooling to writing shaders and automation scripts that speed up production. I prefer dark mode, version control, and code that’s easy to read in six months.",
    "When collaborating, I aim for clarity, low-friction pipelines, and a stable build. I’m happiest when the team can iterate quickly and confidently."
