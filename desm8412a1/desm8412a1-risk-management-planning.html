            <h1>Risk Management Planning</h1>

            <p>As Atlas Games undergoes its rebranding and redesign process, it faces several strategic, technical, and ethical risks that may impact the success of its new digital presence. The following section identifies five key risk categories relevant to the project and proposes realistic, actionable mitigation strategies, grounded in design management principles and entrepreneurial research.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h2>All 5 Possible Risks</h2>

            <h2>Main Risk: User-Centred Risks</h2>

            <h3>Risk</h3>
            <p>The redesigned website may fail to engage users if navigation is unintuitive, storytelling lacks resonance, or visual design does not reflect user expectations. A poor user experience can result in high bounce rates, low click-throughs, and limited retention of both casual players and professional stakeholders such as funders or reviewers. If users encounter excessive friction while exploring the site,such as hidden navigation paths, inconsistent layout patterns, or confusing content hierarchy,they may abandon the website before meaningfully engaging with Atlas Games’ story or projects. Furthermore, without a properly configured domain name system (DNS) and search engine optimisation (SEO) practices, the site risks not being indexed by Google. This would severely reduce discoverability, making it difficult for users to locate the website organically, thereby limiting brand growth and visibility in a competitive indie gaming market. In addition, mobile users, who represent a significant share of the target audience, may disengage quickly if the site lacks responsiveness, fast load speeds, or accessible design features. These risks collectively pose a serious barrier to building trust, community, and long-term brand loyalty.</p>

            <h3>Mitigation Strategy</h3>
            <p>To address these challenges, lightweight yet iterative user testing will be conducted, including informal walkthroughs, task-based trials, and structured feedback surveys with peers, early players, and members of the South African indie gaming community. By adopting a User-Centred Design (UCD) framework (Stone, 2010a), the team will ensure that design decisions remain grounded in actual user behaviour rather than internal assumptions. This involves prioritising mobile-first layouts, clear navigation pathways, and emotionally resonant storytelling that reflects the studio’s identity and values. Accessibility testing will be embedded into the process, ensuring that users across different devices and internet speeds can interact with the site seamlessly.</p>

            <p> From a strategic perspective, this aligns with Liedtka’s (2010) argument that understanding user behaviour is not only a design concern but a driver of organisational success. Incorporating SEO fundamentals,such as metadata, descriptive URLs, and optimised site architecture, will help mitigate discoverability risks and ensure proper indexing by Google. By combining usability testing, responsive technical design, and narrative alignment, the project aims to reduce bounce rates, foster meaningful engagement, and create a professional digital presence capable of supporting both community-building and long-term business objectives.</p>
