            <h1>Design Strategy</h1>

            <h2>Project Definition</h2>

            <h3>Product Overview</h3>
            <p>Atlas Games (formerly The Fruckets) is a South African indie game studio co-founded by three recent graduates: Matthew Rall, Liam Schultz, and Keagan Du Plessis. The studio operates part-time and is currently unfunded, with zero revenue, a pure passion project run alongside job-seeking and freelance work.</p>

            <p>The team's first title, Cancer Crusher, is hosted on Itch.io and showcases a mix of storytelling, personal narrative, and emotional depth. The studio is now undergoing a complete rebrand, shifting from a playful, informal identity to a more professional and aspirational brand: Atlas Games. This includes a new visual system (red, black, grey), a symbolic logo (Atlas holding the planet), and a shift toward impact-driven storytelling.</p>

            <p>According to Brown (2019), positioning design as a strategic tool, rather than just a creative output, is essential when aligning with long-term business goals. This aligns with Atlas Games' intention to evolve from a casual student project into a recognisable brand within the indie game industry.</p>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>This project proposes a strategy to redesign and rebrand the studio's website into a professional platform that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reflects Atlas Games' values of resilience, creativity, and storytelling</li>
                <li>Improves the user experience and engagement on all devices</li>
                <li>Functions as a unified brand hub for games, updates, contact, and growth</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Indie game players who seek emotionally resonant, socially aware narratives</li>
                <li>Reviewers, publishers, grant bodies, and potential collaborators</li>
                <li>South African youth and creatives seeking local voices in game development</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Business Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Launch a new website that represents Atlas Games professionally</li>
                <li>Increase visibility for Cancer Crusher and upcoming projects</li>
                <li>Begin building a contact list of fans, partners, and press</li>
                <li>Position the brand for future funding and community building</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As Liedtka (2010) explains, the relationship between business strategy and design often fails when design decisions are made in isolation from broader market and user considerations. The website redesign is therefore positioned not as decoration, but as a key strategic lever in the studio's growth.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Currently, Atlas Games suffers from fragmented digital representation, with a disjointed Wix website, an isolated Itch.io profile, and no cohesive brand strategy. This inconsistency undermines trust, professional perception, and future scalability. Van Zyl (2023) highlights that early-stage South African design start-ups often lack the infrastructure to communicate value effectively, which limits their access to funding, press, and collaboration opportunities.</p>

            <p>With the rebrand to Atlas Games, there is an urgent need for a unified design strategy that elevates the brand across digital platforms, visually, structurally, and narratively. This strategy should lay the groundwork for long-term growth.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Strategic Framework</h2>

            <h3>Core Design Strategy</h3>
            <p>This redesign adopts a User-Centred Design (UCD) approach, guided by Minimalist Aesthetics and Narrative Identity Design, each selected to reflect Atlas Games' values and constraints.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h4>User-Centred Design</h4>
                <p>User-Centred Design ensures that all decisions, layout, navigation, and structure are grounded in user expectations and habits. This is critical for an audience that includes casual players, funders, and journalists who each require intuitive access to different types of content. As Stone (2010a) explains, strategic thinking in design must begin with understanding both the user journey and the brand's purpose.</p>

                <h4>Minimalist Design</h4>
                <p>Minimalist Design helps simplify the website and reduce cognitive overload. Given the studio's limited resources and content, a minimalist approach ensures that every visual and interactive element serves a purpose. It supports clarity, faster load times, and an uncluttered interface, key to building early trust in a low-attention digital environment.</p>

                <h4>Narrative Identity Design</h4>
                <p>Narrative Identity Design allows Atlas Games to embed its origin story, mission, and creative ethos throughout the site. According to Brown (2019), design strategy should reflect the personality of the brand as much as its usability goals, particularly in creative industries where differentiation is emotional, not just functional.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The combination of these three strategies allows Atlas Games to express who they are, what they stand for, and why it matters, while also delivering a seamless user experience.</p>

            <h3>Design Tools and Approaches</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use of grid-based responsive design for mobile-first accessibility</li>
                <li>Integration with Itch.io via embedded game widgets or buttons</li>
                <li>Branded sections for: About Us, Games, Team, Press, and Contact</li>
                <li>Visual system built around red (energy), black (professionalism), and grey (neutrality/balance)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Measurable Objectives</h2>
            <p>Tracking success is essential to validate the impact of the redesign. According to Lockwood (2007), the true value of design lies not only in creativity but in its measurable contribution to business performance.</p>

                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Objective</th>
                        <th>KPI</th>
                        <th>Timeline</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Launch new brand-aligned website</td>
                        <td>Fully published and functional</td>
                        <td>Within 3 weeks</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Improve user engagement</td>
                        <td>Bounce rate below 40%</td>
                        <td>Within 2 months post-launch</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Grow visibility</td>
                        <td>200% increase in average monthly site visits</td>
                        <td>Within 90 days</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Build an early community</td>
                        <td>100+ newsletter signups or Discord joins</td>
                        <td>Within 6 weeks</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Increase game reach</td>
                        <td>50+ new downloads of Cancer Crusher</td>
                        <td>Within 30 days</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>Each of these objectives is tied directly to user needs (discoverability, ease of navigation, emotional engagement) and business goals (exposure, downloads, early community growth). By designing with measurable outcomes in mind, the studio can evaluate progress and refine its efforts post-launch.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Alignment and Research Approach</h2>
            <p>To ensure that the website redesign is not only functional but strategically sound, the following research and alignment methods will be used.</p>

            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>The team will gather informal feedback from Cancer Crusher players and peers in the South African indie game space. This will include lightweight testing of early prototypes, asking users to complete basic tasks (e.g., "find our game," "contact us") and providing feedback on ease of use and emotional resonance. Stone (2010a) stresses the importance of gathering early-stage insight from real users to validate assumptions and reduce design misalignment.</p>

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>Successful indie studios such as Free Lives, Heart Machine, and Supergiant Games will be used as benchmarking references. These competitors offer valuable insight into how small-to-mid-sized studios use their websites to tell a brand story, showcase products, and build community. These examples will inform the layout and tone of Atlas Games' site.</p>

            <h3>Technical Feasibility Study</h3>
            <p>Given the team's limited technical background and resources, the website will be developed using a no-code or low-code platform (e.g., Webflow, Carrd, or a static GitHub Pages template). This choice ensures faster deployment, ease of maintenance, and responsive design on all devices. This practical consideration reflects the team's real-world constraints, a key aspect of Van Zyl's (2023) model for early-stage South African design enterprises.</p>

            <h3>Alignment with Brand Identity and Business Vision</h3>
            <p>The proposed website design aligns directly with Atlas Games' mission: to tell meaningful, emotional stories through interactive media while uplifting underrepresented voices in game development.</p>

            <p>Visual elements such as the Atlas logo, the red-black-grey colour palette, and clean typography will embody the studio's professional aspirations while maintaining a strong indie personality. Storytelling will be embedded throughout, not only in the games but in how the brand speaks to its users.</p>

            <p>As Liedtka (2010) points out, design is most impactful when it operates as a bridge between user understanding and strategic intent. This project is a practical example of that principle: ensuring the website reflects both who Atlas Games is and what it wants to become.</p>
